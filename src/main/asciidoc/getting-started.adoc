== Introducing Spring Cloud Spinnaker

http://spinnaker.io[Spinnaker] is a multi-cloud continuous deployment platform released by Netflix with contributions
from Pivotal, Google, Microsoft and others. *Spring Cloud Spinnaker* is an installation tool meant to gather all the
necessary information and use it to deploy Spinnaker's microservices into a
https://www.cloudfoundry.org/use/cloud-foundry-certified/[certified Cloud Foundry installation].

It installs the follow Spinnaker components:

.Spinnaker modules
[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Module | Purpose

| clouddriver
| Carries out all cloud-based operations, e.g. deploy, resize, destroy, etc.

| deck
| Frontend UI

| echo
| Sends messages out over various channels like Slack and email

| fiat
| Security enforcement module. _Coming soon!_

| front50
| Manages long term and inflight data, e.g. pipeline definitions and currently running pipelines

| gate
| Gateway API between the frontend (deck) and the backend services

| igor
| Polls for CI job status, e.g. Jenkins and Travis

| orca
| Orchestration engine used for all operations and pipelines
|===

NOTE: Spinnaker has other modules, but they aren't needed for a Cloud Foundry setup. For example, there is a module dedicate
to wrapping JAR artifacts as http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html[Amazon AMIs], also known as "baking", but Cloud Foundry doesn't need baking.

== Before installing Spinnaker

Before you actually install Spinnaker, you must decide where it will run, i.e. pick an organization and space. You
also need the following services created as well:

* An instance of Redis in the same space.


== Installing Spinnaker

Composed of Boot-based microservices, Spinnaker is highly customizable. Instead of tuning
ever single setting, Spring Cloud Spinnaker lets you pick several options from a web page, and will in turn apply the needed property settings for you.

To get the bits, visit https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-spinnaker. Included are download directions to run it locally, to upload it somewhere in your CF, or to run a hosted solution from Pivotal Web Services.

=== Settings

After installing Spring Cloud Spinnaker, whether locally or in PCF somewhere, you will be faced with a collection of
settings. This may look like a lot, but compared to ALL the options Spinnaker comes with, this is a vast simplification.

The settings are split into two parts: *Target* and *Settings*.

* *Target* describes information needed to "cf push" all the Spinnaker modules.
* *Settings* is information used to apply the right property settings after installation so that Spinnaker can do its own deployments.

The following settings are needed to install Spinnaker modules.

.Installation Settings
[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Setting | Purpose

| Target API
| URL for the API where Spinnaker will be installed (Using PWS? There's a shortcut button to enter its URL.)

| Target Email
| Email to log into CF and install Spinnaker

| Target Password
| Password to log into CF and install Spinnaker

| Refresh
| With *API*, *email*, and *password* hit this button and you'll be presented with all the org/space pairs you have access to pick a destination.

| Target Organization
| Drop down showing organization you want Spinnaker installed in

| Target Space
| Drop down showing space you want Spinnaker installed in

| Namespace
| Optional suffix to apply to Spinnaker module names (e.g. *test* will yield *deck-test*)
|===

The following information is used by Spinnaker after installation to do its job.

.Operations Settings
[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Setting | Purpose

| Redis Service
| Name of the Redis service clouddriver, echo, front50, and orca must bind to. Click "Pick from a list" to get a drop down of redis services in your selected space. NOTE: You must create this instance of Redis yourself. Spring Cloud Spinnaker doesn't have the option to create it for you.

| Default Org
| Organization where Spinnaker will make deployments. This is pre-filled from *Target Organization* up above, but can be
overridden. (_Coming: Multiple organization support_)

| Default Space
| Space where Spinnaker will make deployments. This is pre-filled from *Target Space* up above, but can be
overridden. (_Coming: Multiple space support_)

| Primary Account API
| URL for the API where Spinnaker will make deployments. This is pre-filled from *Target API* up above, but can be
overridden.

| Primary Account Console
| URL for App Manager (In PWS, it's https://console.run.pivotal.io)

| Second Account?
| Enable you to add a second organzation and space, along with similar settings.

| Account Name
| Account name for Spinnaker to use when logging into PCF. Copied from *Target Email* but can be overriden.

| Account Password
| Account password for Spinnaker to use when logging into PCF. Copied from *Target Password* but can be overriden.

| Repository Name/Access Code
| If you are pulling deployment artifacts from an http-based repository, put your username. If s3, put your access code

NOTE: If your repository isn't secured, leave blank

| Repository Password/Secret Code
| If you are pulling deployment artifacts from an http-based repository, put your password. If s3, put your secret code

 NOTE: If your repository isn't secured, leave blank

| SSL?
| If using PCF on a closed network, disable SSL to avoid failing security checks between Spinnaker components caused by self-signed certificates.

| Jenkins?
| Enable you to enter Jenkins details.

| Travis?
| Enable you to enter Travis details.

| Slack?
| Enable Slack notifications. (Includes hyperlink to proper place to create a Bot token value.)

| Email?
| Enable Email notifications by entering a collection of attributes. Certain values are pre-loaded if you enter a Gmail or Yahoo email address. Otherwise you'll need to find proper settings for your email server.

| OAuth?
| Enable authentication with an OAuth provider. (Includes links to Github and Google pages to create a client/secret pair).

| Refresh list of omains
| Click to look up a list of valid domains for the Spinnaker modules.

| Domain
| Domain that Spinnaker will be installed into.

| All Account Names
| List of account names Spinnaker will interact with (separated by commas). This is pre-filled from *Primary Account Name*,
but can be overridden.
|===

With your settings filled in, click on the Status tab.

=== Deploying

On the Status tab, you have the ability to check each module, or deal with them all.

. Click on *Deploy All*.
. Sit back and sip on a cup of coffee. This will take some time.

Once completed, you can click *Stop All* or *Start All* to stop/start the whole set.

You can click *Link All* and the names of each module will have a hyperlink added, taking you to App Manager.

== Next Steps

After getting Spinnaker up and running, you should be able to access deck, the UI for Spinnaker, by visiting
https://deck.<your domain>
